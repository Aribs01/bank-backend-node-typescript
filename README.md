# Bank Backend Using Node (Typescript)

## A RESTful API made with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - [MySQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - [Knex](http://knexjs.org/) - [JWT](https://jwt.io/)
<br>

## Main Features üë• üè°

This API is perfect for simple banking tasks, create users with accounts, create and transfer funds between users

## Installation
1. Before all, check if you have Node.js and npm installed, going on your terminal and typing:
    - **`node --version`**
    - **`npm --version`**

2. If these commands are unrecognized by your terminal, go to **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)** page to download and install it. Then go to step 1 again.

3. After that, you can clone the project to your local machine using:
    - **`git clone https://github.com/Aribs01/bank-backend-node-typescript`**
    - Or if you prefer to download it, just click on the green Code button above and click in **`Download ZIP`**

4. Now you have to enter the project folder and open it on your prefered IDE. I strongly recommend **[Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**:
    - Just **`cd Authorization-master`** if you are running through terminal, and then **`code .`** to open the project folder on VS Code.

5. Open the terminal inside the IDE (usually **`Ctrl + J`** in VS Code on Windows) and then type the command for the package manager to download the necessary dependencies for the project to work.
    - **`npm install`**

6. Now you have to setup the environment variables by creating a **`.env`** at the root of the project.

7. Paste the blank **`.env`** variables below inside the **`.env`** file you created. Don't worry about this now, you will change and understand them:

    ```
    API_HOST=127.0.0.1
    API_PORT=3000

    NODE_ENV=development

    DB_NAME=put_the_username_you_want_for_the_database
    DB_USER=put_the_username_you_want_for_the_database
    DB_PASS=put_the_password_you_want_for_the_database

    ```
8. Now I'll explain you each one of these variables and their function in the application: Note that all variables will be converted to `string` when read by the dotenv module.
    - **`API_HOST`** is the host that the server will use to listen the requests you make to the API. Be careful if you want to change it!
    - **`API_PORT`** is the port that the server will use to listen the requests you make to the API. You can keep 3000 or change to anyone you want. But be careful!
    - **`NODE_ENV`** is the environment of the API. You can change it to `development` or `staging` or `production`, but make this before starting the API.
    - **`DB_NAME`** is the name of the database, used when you are in a `staging` or `production` environment. `development` uses a local SQLite3 database.
    - **`DB_USER`** is the username used to connect to the database specified above.
    - **`DB_PASS`** is the password used to connect to the database specified above.

9. After setting all the variables in the **`.env`** file, you only need to run the API. I will teach you below.
